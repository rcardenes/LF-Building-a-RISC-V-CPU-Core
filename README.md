RV32I minimal implementation
============================

This is a RISC-V basic core implementation following LF's course, which is centered around the MakerChip tool (TL-Verilog). It describes a 1-cycle per instruction, no I/O core.

Not a hugely useful one, but it serves as an introduction to the architecture.
